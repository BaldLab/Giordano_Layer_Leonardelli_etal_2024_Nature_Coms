## Abstract

The chemokine CXCL12 promotes glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence after radiotherapy (RT) by facilitating vasculogenesis. Here, we report outcomes of the dose-escalation part of GLORIA (NCT04121455), a phase I/II trial combining RT and the CXCL12-neutralizing aptamer olaptesed pegol (NOX-A12; 200/400/600 mg per week) in patients with incompletely resected, newly diagnosed GBM lacking MGMT methylation.  

The primary endpoint was safety; secondary endpoints included maximum tolerable dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), NOX-A12 plasma levels, topography of recurrence, tumor vascularization, neurologic assessment in neuro-oncology (NANO), quality of life (QOL), median progression-free survival (PFS), 6-months PFS, and overall survival (OS).  

Treatment was safe, with no dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related deaths. The MTD was not reached, and 600 mg per week of NOX-A12 was established as the RP2D for the ongoing expansion part of the trial. With increasing NOX-A12 dose levels, a corresponding increase in NOX-A12 plasma levels was observed. Of ten patients enrolled, nine showed radiographic responses, and four reached partial remission.  

All but one patient (90%) showed reduced perfusion values in terms of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV). The median PFS was 174 (range 58-260) days, 6-month PFS was 40.0%, and the median OS was 389 (144-562) days. In a post-hoc exploratory analysis of tumor tissue, a higher frequency of CXCL12+ endothelial and glioma cells was significantly associated with longer PFS under NOX-A12.  

Our data imply the safety of NOX-A12, and its efficacy signal warrants further investigation.
